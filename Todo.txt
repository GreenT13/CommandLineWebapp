Basic things we should do:
# Create JUnit tests for the backend.
# Create tests for the frontend?
# Update documentation with current situation.

Useful:
# Parse command messages with markdown in the frontend to HTML.

Sexy stuff:
# Refactor frontend a bit so it is more logical to process return commands?
  Only needed when backend supports it, but nice to do anyway. Frontend feels a little bit cluttered.
# Think of some way to have a waitForInput() in commands.

Cool enhancement:
# Classpath management. Store some libraries in the database, allow plugins to use these libraries.
  Also allow plugins to be a lib for other plugins.
  The uploader of the plugin should be able to specify the classpath. Maybe we can even detect
  the classpath from the pom.xml or manifest?
